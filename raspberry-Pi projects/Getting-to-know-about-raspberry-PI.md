## project:Getting-to-know-about-raspberry-PI

### Raspberry pi-
it is a mini computer. You can run light weight version of linux on it. You can watch movies on it. What ever you can do a regular laptop you can do on a raspberry pi theoritically. Raspberry pi because of its small size obviously has lot less processing power and memory that your regular laptop. What makes it really awesome is the capacity of a computer in its small size. You can take Raspberry Pi to places that you cant take your laptop to.

### Pi Face -
it is a small circuit board that you use to extend the capacity of a Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi has many GPIO pins with which it can interact with real external hardware. Pi Face enhances this capacity. It gives you a lot more input pins and output pins than what raspberry pi gives by default (8 input pin and 8 output pin).
