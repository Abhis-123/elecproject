link:http://likemagicappears.com/projects/raspberry-pi-cluster/

In the practical sense, this is a supercomputer which has been scaled down to the point where the entire system is about as fast as a nice desktop system(the normal system is slower then normal desktop).the need of computing cluster that one could use for testing distributed software. Since I donâ€™t have free access to a traditional supercomputer.


The goals of this project are :
1.Build a model supercomputer, which structurally mimics a modern supercomputer.
2.All hardware required for the cluster to operate is housed in a case no larger than a full tower.
3.Parts that are likely to fail should be easy to replace.
4.It should be space-efficient, energy-efficient, economically-efficient, and well-constructed.
