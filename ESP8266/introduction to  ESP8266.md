## Project:introduction to  ESP8266:-



### Discription ESP8266-ESP-01 Module:-
VCC: It is the power pin through which 3.3V is supplied.
GND: It is the ground pin.
TX: This pin is used to transmit serial data to other devices.
RX: The RX pin is used to receive serial data from other devices.
RST: It is the Reset Pin and it is an active LOW Pin. (ESP8266 will reset if the RST pin receives LOW signal).
CH_PD: This is the chip enable pin and it is an active HIGH Pin. It is usually connected to 3.3V.
GPIO0: The GPIO0 (General Purpose I/O) Pin has dual functions â€“ one for normal GPIO Operation and other for enabling the Programming Mode of ESP8266.
GPIO2: This is GPIO Pin.
