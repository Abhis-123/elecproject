## Project:Auto Intensity Control of street lights:
in older days the street lights were controlld manually.But today these work automaticaly.By controlling lights according to time and 
traffic we save a lot of energy.

### The Hardwere for this project:-
ATmega8 micro controller, DS 1307 IC, LDR,LCD display,PIR sensor and RTC.
Principal:-
The System consists of Atmega8 microcontroller, LDR, PIR sensor and RTC.System controlls the light using PIR sensor and light dependent 
resister.Street lights are switched on depending on the intensity of the Sun light on LDR.If the intensity of Sunlight on light dependent
resistor is low, its resistance value is high. This value increases and becomes high when it is completely in dark. This resistance 
value decides when the street lights are required to switch ON.
PIR detects the presence of vehicles .Whenever PIR sensor is detected it just indicates the microcontroller to switch on the street 
lights
